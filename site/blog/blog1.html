                <p>Recycling is important in today’s world if we want to leave this planet for our future generations.
                    It is good for the environment, since we are making new products from the old products which are of no use
                    to us. Recycling begins at home. If you are not throwing away any of your old product and instead utilizing
                    it for something new then you are actually recycling. When you think of recycling you should really
                    think about the whole idea; reduce, reuse and recycle. We’ve been careless up to this point with the
                    way we’ve treated the Earth and it’s time to change; not just the way we do things but the way we think.

                <h2>Why Should We Recycle</h2>
                <p>Recycling is good for the environment, in the sense, we are using old and waste products which are of no
                    use and then converting them back to same new products. Since we are saving resources and are sending
                    less trash to the landfills, it helps in reducing air and water pollution. Energy saving is important
                    if we are to reduce the future effects of global warming. If we recycle one aluminum can, we are able
                    to save enough energy to run a TV for around 3 hours. This will obviously depend on the energy
                    consumption of your TV, but it gives you a great idea as to just how much energy can be saved during
                    the process of recycling products.</p>
