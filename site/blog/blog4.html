                <p>“If you collect rubbish and ship it to China that’s not recycling, that’s just collecting.”
                    Dr Karl Williams, head of the centre for waste and resource management at the University of Central
                    Lancashire, says he’s looked at a lot of rubbish in his career.
                </p>
                <p>And though Europe is going through its own crisis at the moment, like Australia, he suspects that
                    the difference between the two territories is that Europe has a better class of trash. On January 1,
                    China imposed a ban on the importation of lower-grade waste such as plastic scraps or mixed,
                    unsorted paper. The ban hit Australia hard, with companies walking away from waste collection
                    contracts, and recycling being stockpiled by councils who could not find anywhere to send it.
                    Europe has not escaped either. The European Union champions the “circular economy” and likes to
                    boast that its energy and resources are carefully reused and recycled. But the circle is far from
                    complete. Only 40 per cent of the continent’s waste is reused or recycled, and it sends millions of
                    tonnes of paper and plastics overseas. In 2016, of the 8.4 million tonnes of plastic waste the EU
                    collected, almost one-fifth ended up in China. When China imposed new limits on foreign waste
                    imports at the beginning of the year, the system clogged up. Pascal Gennevieve, head of paper at
                    French recycler Federec, told Politico in February that, “Right after the Christmas peak we had a
                    lot of paper and no export solution. All European plants are full, saturated.”
                    There was a scramble across the continent, Dr Williams says.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, there will have to be short-term solutions. One, Dr Williams admits, sounds
                    familiar. “Europe is also looking at opening up other markets [to sell waste to], other South-east
                    Asian countries. They’re looking at Vietnam, places like that, which have less strict waste
                    management.” </p>
