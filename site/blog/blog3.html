            <p>Sweden is so good at recycling that, for several years, it has imported rubbish from other countries
                to keep its recycling plants going. Less than 1 per cent of Swedish household waste was sent to
                landfill last year or any year since 2011.
            </p>
            <p>Their system is so far ahead because of a culture of looking after the environment. Sweden was one of
                the first countries to implement a heavy tax on fossil fuels in 1991 and now sources almost half its
                electricity from renewables.</p>

            <p>Over time, Sweden has implemented a cohesive national recycling policy so that even though private
                companies undertake most of the business of importing and burning waste, the energy goes into a
                national heating network to heat homes through the freezing Swedish winter. “That’s a key reason that
                we have this district network, so we can make use of the heating from the waste plants. In the southern
                part of Europe they don’t make use of the heating from the waste, it just goes out the chimney. Here
                we use it as a substitute for fossil fuel,” says Anna-Carin Gripwall, director of communications for
                Avfall Sverige, the Swedish Waste Management’s recycling association. </p>
