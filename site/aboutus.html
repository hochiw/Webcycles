            <h2>Webcycles is project aimed towards motivating the public to recycle more and have fun doing so as well. Our team consisting of 3 university students found out that we and the people around us weren’t recycling at all. Simply throwing garbage rather than separating recyclables and non- recyclables was much more convenient. Through surveys that we’ve conducted, we found out that people generally knew about the benefits that recycling brings. However, many claimed that they didn’t have a direct impact from recycling which put them off from going through the hassle to recycle.</h2>

            <h2>We came up with the idea to give recycling a new meaning. We decided to make a recycling-based game that would require the player to add their recycled amount into their account to convert into in-game points. This would then be contributed to one of the three selected charities of the month. The winning charity would be awarded a donation from the participating sponsors. We also made a recycling focused blog to inspire better recycling habits.   </h2>
